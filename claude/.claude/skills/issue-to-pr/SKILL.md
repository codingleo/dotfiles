name: issue-to-pr
description: >
  End-to-end workflow that turns a single GitHub issue into a merged-ready pull request
  using persona-driven BDD and strict multi-layer TDD. Always creates a git worktree for the
  issue (skips if already in a worktree) with an issue-linked branch name
  (`feat|fix|…/<issue-number>-<slug>`). Given an issue number/#/URL (or legacy beads id),
  it role-plays the app's real target users (creators, solopreneurs, MEIs, local SMBs) to
  write Gherkin covering jobs-to-be-done, workflows, digital fluency, and confusion/recovery
  paths—not only happy paths—then validates with parallel expert lenses (persona/UX, BA, QA,
  architect), writes failing tests at every layer (unit, integration, acceptance, regression,
  E2E), implements only enough code to go green, visually verifies on megazord, commits,
  pushes, opens a PR with Closes #N, and hands off. Use when the user says "solve this
  issue", "issue-to-pr", "/issue-to-pr", "take issue X to a PR", "implement issue #N", or
  points at an issue and asks for a full TDD implementation-to-PR pass.

# issue-to-pr

Drive one issue from intake to an open PR without skipping:

1. **Persona-driven Gherkin** (predict simplification / confusion / recovery before code)
2. **Red → Green → Refactor** at **every** relevant test layer
3. Visual check + PR handoff

You orchestrate; sub-agents validate Gherkin in parallel. Do **not** implement product code until Gherkin is reconciled **and** the red suite is written and proven red for the right reasons.

## Non-negotiables (this repo)

Read `references/project-conventions.md` **before starting**. Load-bearing rules:

- **Always work in a git worktree for the issue** (see Step 0). If the session is **already** inside a linked worktree, skip creation and continue.
- **Branch names must include the GitHub issue number** so work links on GitHub (`<type>/<issue-number>-<kebab-slug>`).
- **Branch off `develop`, never commit to `develop`/`main`.** PRs target `develop` by default.
- **Gherkin before tests; tests before implementation.** No tests-after. No “implement then document.”
- **Behavior change ⇒ failing test FIRST**, confirmed failing for the *right reason* (assertion, not import/setup).
- **Browser/E2E URL is `megazord.olhaminha.bio`, never `localhost:3000`.** Don't restart the user's dev server; ask them to.
- **Never `git add -A`.** Stage named files only.
- **Never leak local filesystem paths** into commits/PRs/generated files.
- Runtime is **Bun**: `bun test`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run gherkin:generate`.
- Generated Gherkin under `tests/features/_generated/**` **is committed**.
- **GitHub Issues are the system of record** (`gh issue`). Do not use `bd` / beads / TodoWrite as task tracking for this workflow (session progress checklists are fine).

## Workflow order (hard)

```
Intake + worktree + issue-linked branch
  → Persona walkthrough → Gherkin → Multi-lens validation
  → RED (unit · integration · acceptance · regression · E2E as applicable)
  → GREEN (minimum implementation)
  → Visual verify → Commit / push / PR → Handoff
```

Never reorder to “code first, tests later.”

---

### Step 0 — Intake, worktree & issue-linked branch

#### 0A — Resolve the issue

1. Resolve the issue reference:
   - Bare number / `#N` / GitHub URL → `gh issue view <n> --comments`.
   - Legacy `olhaminha.bio-*` beads id → only if still present; prefer the linked GitHub issue.
   - If ambiguous, ask.
2. Extract **user-visible behavior**, acceptance criteria, Example Map (rules/examples/questions), constraints, and plan/tier limits that matter. If thin, explore cited code first (`Explore` agent for multi-file scope).
3. Claim work: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me` (and `in-progress` label if the repo uses it). Comment a one-line plan if useful.

Capture for the rest of the run:

- `ISSUE_NUMBER` — digits only (e.g. `2444`)
- `TYPE` — `feat|fix|hotfix|chore` from issue kind
- `SLUG` — short kebab of the title (3–6 words, no issue number repeated)

#### 0B — Detect existing worktree (skip if already isolated)

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(git rev-parse --git-dir)
GIT_COMMON=$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)
# Submodule guard: if this prints a path, you are in a submodule — treat as normal repo (create worktree).
git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree 2>/dev/null
```

- If `GIT_DIR` ≠ `GIT_COMMON` **and** you are **not** in a submodule → **already in a linked worktree**. Do **not** nest another worktree. Ensure the current branch still matches the issue-linked naming rules below (rename/create only if the branch has no issue number). Then **skip to Step 1**.
- Otherwise → create a worktree (0C).

#### 0C — Branch name (must link the GitHub issue)

**Required pattern:**

```text
<type>/<issue-number>-<kebab-slug>
```

Examples:

| Issue | Branch |
|-------|--------|
| #2444 scroll shell | `feat/2444-single-scrollport-layout` |
| #2448 publish capacity | `feat/2448-publish-capacity-meters` |
| Bug on Socials | `fix/2450-list-filter-empty-state` |

Rules:

- **Always include the numeric issue id** as the first path segment after `type/` (GitHub + humans can associate branch ↔ issue).
- Do **not** put a bare `#` in the branch name (awkward to shell-escape); the digits are enough. Linkage is completed by PR body `Closes #<n>` and commit messages that mention `#<n>`.
- Slug from the issue title; lowercase; hyphens; no spaces.
- Confirm you are **never** committing on `develop` / `main`.

#### 0D — Create worktree + branch from `develop`

From the **main repo root** (not inside an existing worktree):

```bash
# 1) Refresh base
git fetch origin develop
git rev-parse origin/develop   # sanity

# 2) Worktree directory (prefer project .worktrees/, must be gitignored)
#    Prefer .worktrees/ if present; else create it and ensure ignored.
mkdir -p .worktrees
git check-ignore -q .worktrees || {
  echo ".worktrees/" >> .gitignore   # only if not already ignored by a broader rule;
  # Prefer editing existing ignore policy if the repo already documents worktrees — do not
  # force-commit a drive-by .gitignore change without need. If .worktrees is already ignored, skip.
}

BRANCH="<type>/<issue-number>-<kebab-slug>"   # e.g. feat/2444-single-scrollport-layout
WT_PATH=".worktrees/${BRANCH}"                # e.g. .worktrees/feat/2444-single-scrollport-layout

# 3) Create branch + worktree at origin/develop
git worktree add -b "$BRANCH" "$WT_PATH" origin/develop

# 4) All subsequent file edits, tests, commits happen inside WT_PATH
cd "$WT_PATH"
```

If a worktree or branch for this issue **already exists** (`git worktree list`, `git branch --list "*/${ISSUE_NUMBER}-*"`):

- Reuse it: `cd` into that worktree path and continue (do not create a second one).
- If the branch exists but has no worktree, `git worktree add "$WT_PATH" "$BRANCH"`.

If `git worktree add` fails (permissions/sandbox): report the error, fall back to a normal branch in the current clone only after telling the user isolation failed — still use the **issue-linked branch name**.

Optional: after worktree create, if the project needs install: `bun install` only when `node_modules` is missing in the worktree and the user environment expects a local install (many monorepos share nothing — follow project norms; don't thrash if already linked).

#### 0E — Confirm ready

Before Step 1:

- [ ] `pwd` is the worktree path (or skipped because already in a worktree)
- [ ] `git branch --show-current` matches `<type>/<issue-number>-…`
- [ ] Branch is **not** `develop` / `main`
- [ ] `git status` clean enough to start (or WIP is intentional for this issue only)

---

### Step 1 — Persona walkthrough → Gherkin (before any product code)

**Goal:** Scenarios that a real LookMyBio user would live through—including where they get stuck—so Gherkin forces simplify / clarify / recover work, not only the engineer happy path.

#### 1A — Load who we build for

Read **`references/persona-gherkin.md`** (method + confusion catalog) and, in-repo when available:

- `marketing/reference/audiences.md` — segments A–E, JTBD, pains, fluency
- `marketing/reference/product-truth.md` — what the product actually does (never invent capabilities)
- `docs/bdd/example-mapping.md` + `docs/bdd/gherkin-conventions.md` — formulation rules

Pick **1–2 primary personas** for this issue (default beachhead: **B solopreneur/coach** and/or **E Brazilian creator/MEI**). Note secondary if the surface is freemium (A) or local SMB (C).

For each persona, write a short **role card** (private notes, not necessarily committed):

| Field | Prompt |
|-------|--------|
| Who | Segment, goals, language (en / pt-BR), mobile vs desktop bias |
| Job today | What they are trying to finish in one sitting |
| Fluency | Low / med / high digital IQ; tolerance for jargon, density, multi-step flows |
| Constraints | Time-poor, plan tier (Free vs Creator+), credits, connected platforms |
| Success | Observable outcome they would screenshot or brag about |
| Confusion risks | What wording, empty states, gates, or chrome would make them bounce |

#### 1B — Cognitive walkthrough (act as the user)

Walk the intended flow **in character**. For every step of the issue's workflow, ask:

1. **Goal** — What am I trying to do right now (not what the system is doing)?
2. **Discoverability** — Would I find the control without training? What do I click first by mistake?
3. **Meaning** — Do I understand the label, icon, badge, remaining quota, error in my language?
4. **Feedback** — After I act, do I know if it worked, is loading, or failed—and what to do next?
5. **Recovery** — If I fail (wrong plan, 0 credits, no connection, cap hit, empty library), can I fix it without support?
6. **Anxiety** — What would scare me (publish to wrong account, lose credits, look unprofessional)?
7. **Simplify** — What should the product hide, default, rename, or block earlier so I never hit this edge?

Capture findings as **candidate scenarios** (not implementation todos):

- Happy path (job completed)
- First-run / empty / zero-connection / free-tier walls
- Confused path (wrong mental model → still safe or guided)
- Error + recovery (actionable copy, not only HTTP status)
- Permission / plan / quota gates
- Mobile / touch / keyboard dual-path when the issue is UI
- pt-BR wording risk when the issue ships user-facing strings
- Regression of adjacent jobs (calendar, create, providers) the epic marks non-goals for *change* but still must not break

Trace candidates back to Example Map rules (`R#` / `R#-E#`). If the issue has no map, draft one in the issue comment or feature header before formulating.

#### 1C — Write `.feature` files

Under `tests/features/<domain>/`:

1. Follow `docs/bdd/gherkin-conventions.md` (tags, harnesses, ubiquitous language).
2. Prefer **observable user outcomes** in `Then` (UI state, DTO fields the user cares about, blocked action with reason)—not internal private method names.
3. Title scenarios by **behavior + outcome**, not implementation.
4. Include a feature-header comment listing unit/E2E coverage that lives elsewhere when relevant.
5. Run `bun run gherkin:generate` (commit generated artifacts later with the feature).

If the change is **genuinely not user-visible**, document the N/A reason and skip to Step 3 with unit/integration/regression only—still persona-check any operator-facing errors/logs if they surface in product UI.

**Quality bar for Step 1:** If a junior marketer / nano creator with medium patience would need a Loom to use the feature, the Gherkin is incomplete until confusion/recovery scenarios exist (or the product is simplified so those scenarios become impossible).

---

### Step 2 — Multi-lens validation (parallel)

Dispatch **four agents in a single message**. Full prompts + reconciliation: `references/gherkin-validation.md`.

| Lens | Focus |
|------|--------|
| **Persona / UX** | Fluency, JTBD fit, confusion/recovery, copy clarity, mobile/pt-BR; forces simplify vs document |
| **Business Analyst** | Every AC / Example Map rule maps to a scenario; outcomes are user-observable |
| **QA / Edge-Case** | Boundaries, authz, concurrency, idempotency, empty/max, failure modes |
| **Architect** | Feasibility in *this* codebase; correct test layer; reuse existing services/DI |

Reconcile: **blockers + majors must be fixed** in the features. Prefer simplify the product when persona and QA both flag the same confusion. Re-run `bun run gherkin:generate`. If revisions were material, re-run only the affected lens once. **Do not** pause for user approval here unless a product question is unresolved in the Example Map (then comment on the issue and ask).

---

### Step 3 — Red: failing tests at every applicable layer

**Do not implement product behavior yet.** Map each reconciled scenario (and each new branch the design needs) to the **lowest correct layer**, then write tests that fail first.

| Layer | When | How |
|-------|------|-----|
| **Unit** | Pure domain rules, mappers, validators, hooks, reducers, small UI pure helpers | `bun test <path>` — mock at package boundaries (see conventions) |
| **Integration** | Repos, services, Mongo, queues, rate-limit remaining, oRPC wiring | `RUN_MONGO_TESTS=1` / `bun run test:integration` as appropriate |
| **Acceptance** | User-visible rules expressed in Gherkin (use-case / domain / orpc harness) | `bun run gherkin:test --tags '…'` or generated suite for the feature |
| **Regression** | Adjacent non-goals must stay green; prior bugs for this surface; architectural token guards | Re-run related existing tests + dashboard `_architectural/` if dashboard UI |
| **E2E** | Multi-step browser journeys, auth, visual affordances that unit can't prove | Playwright against **`megazord.olhaminha.bio`** with test credentials |

**Coverage mandate:** every new branch, error path, permission check, validator boundary, queue/retry state, and user-recovery path gets a **direct** test at the right layer (CRAP risk). Persona confusion scenarios that only exist as “copy must say X” still need an assertion (string key / role text / disabled reason).

**Acceptance harnesses that `new` a use case:** after every rebase onto `develop`, re-open the **production constructor** and match arity/arg order.

**Prove red correctly:**

1. Run each new/changed test file.
2. Confirm failure is an **assertion / missing behavior**, not import/compile/setup.
3. Mutation/sensitivity: temporarily wrong expectation or missing branch still fails; restore.
4. A red that only errors is **not** a valid red—fix the test harness first.

Record the red commands + failure snippets for the handoff.

---

### Step 4 — Green: implement the minimum

Only after Step 3 reds are honest:

1. Implement the **smallest** change that satisfies the tests, DDD layers (Domain → Application → Infrastructure → UI), existing services/DI tokens.
2. Prefer **product simplification** called out by persona scenarios (clearer empty state, earlier gate, better default) over piling more chrome.
3. Loop until reds go green; then full relevant suites + `bun run typecheck` + lint.
4. Dashboard TSX → also `bun test tests/unit/app/dashboard/_architectural/`.
5. Refactor while staying green.

Marketing/copy claims must stay inside `marketing/reference/product-truth.md` reality.

---

### Step 5 — Visual verification

Invoke **`/visual-app-verify`** (or project `visual-app-verify` / `dev-browser-visual-testing`) against **`megazord.olhaminha.bio`**. Walk the **persona happy path + one confusion/recovery path** from the Gherkin.

- Tunnel 530 / Unauthorized → ask user to restore tunnel; localhost only with explicit agreement.
- Collapsed UI must still **look expandable** (chevron/label/focus)—not pointer-only.

---

### Step 6 — Loop on failure

On any gate failure, return to the **earliest** broken step (often Gherkin or red honesty). Use systematic debugging, not guess-fixes. After ~3 unproductive cycles on the same gate, stop and report the blocker with evidence.

---

### Step 7 — Commit, push, PR

Run **inside the issue worktree**.

1. If behind `origin/develop`, rebase **before** first push; re-run acceptance (constructor drift).
2. Stage **named files** only. Logical commits that mention the issue, e.g.:
   - `test(acceptance): #2444 scroll shell scenarios` — features + `_generated`
   - `test: #2444 unit reds for scroll ownership`
   - `feat: #2444 single scrollport layout shell`
3. Push the **issue-linked branch**: `git push -u origin HEAD`. **Verify** with `git ls-remote origin <branch>` matching local `HEAD`.
4. **Confirm PR base with the user** (default `develop`) — only required human checkpoint.
5. `gh pr create --base <confirmed> --head <branch>` with: what/why, **`Closes #<issue-number>`** (required so GitHub links/closes the issue), red/green evidence, acceptance scenarios, persona notes, worktree/branch name, no local paths.

---

### Step 8 — Handoff summary

Mandatory:

- **Personas used** and top confusion risks addressed (or simplified away).
- **Red**: command + failure reason (per major layer).
- **Green**: command + pass.
- **Acceptance coverage**: `.feature` paths/scenarios (or N/A reason).
- **Test matrix**: unit / integration / acceptance / regression / E2E — what ran, what N/A.
- **CRAP-risk mitigation**: new branches/error paths with direct tests.
- **PR link** + issue closed (`Closes #N`).
- **Branch + worktree**: issue-linked branch name; note if worktree was created or reused/skipped.
- **Browser steps** for the user: URL on megazord, credentials if needed, click-path for happy + one recovery path.

Session close: `git status` → named stage → commit → push → verify push (from the worktree).
