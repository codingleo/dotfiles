# Megazord Code Review

Run a read-only, evidence-first review. Preserve the requested scope and do not implement fixes unless the user explicitly asks for them.

## Workflow

1. Establish the review target.
   - Read the repository instructions before inspecting the change.
   - Use the user-specified pull request, branch, commit, range, or files. Otherwise resolve the base from pull-request metadata or the repository's configured merge target. Ask when multiple bases are plausible; never silently assume a default branch.
   - Record the exact reviewed range or file set. For a branch review, compute the merge base with the resolved target and include relevant tracked and untracked worktree changes.
   - For a live pull request, record the current head SHA and distinguish current code and checks from outdated comments, superseded diffs, and earlier CI failures.
   - Inspect changed files, callers, tests, data models, and runtime or configuration paths needed to understand behavior. Do not judge the diff in isolation.
   - Record unrelated pre-existing worktree changes and leave them untouched.

2. Prepare a neutral evidence packet.
   - Include the user intent, review range or baseline, raw diff or changed paths, applicable repository instructions, and relevant validation commands.
   - Give every reviewer the same scope and enough repository access to trace behavior.
   - Do not include suspected defects, expected answers, or conclusions from another reviewer.

3. Dispatch the specialist panel.
   - Read [references/reviewers.md](references/reviewers.md) before delegating.
   - Start one fresh subagent for each of the eight lenses: performance, simplicity, design patterns, QA, code quality, security, CRAP analysis, and anti-AI slop.
   - Use clean, non-inherited contexts such as `fork_turns=none`, passing only the neutral evidence packet and one lens. Do not combine lenses in one reviewer.
   - Use parallel waves when concurrency is limited. Collect all eight responses before synthesizing.
   - Ask reviewers to inspect and report only; do not let them edit files.
   - Require each reviewer to return findings or explicitly say `No findings` or `Not applicable`.
   - If subagents are unavailable, disclose that limitation and apply the same eight lenses sequentially.

4. Verify every candidate finding.
   - Reproduce the relevant code path and independently confirm the claim against the actual change and baseline. Never decide by reviewer vote.
   - Run focused, non-mutating tests or diagnostics when they materially strengthen or disprove a claim.
   - For every newly introduced raw query, unsafe API, manual parser, broad type assertion, or custom framework workaround, require a concrete reason a typed repository primitive cannot preserve the needed semantics or measured performance. If a typed query can fetch an already-bounded candidate set and an existing helper can apply the unsupported predicate, report the low-level implementation as maintainability risk. Parameterization can prevent injection without making database-specific SQL the best design.
   - Before calling an input or value unused, trace framework-visible uses such as cache identity, routing, serialization, invalidation, and type-level contracts.
   - Verify that tests exercise production behavior. A mocked-child adapter test is useful only when it proves a deliberate parent contract that types and existing tests do not cover. Treat a large mock that recreates child controls and interactions as redundant when real child tests plus integration or E2E coverage already prove the flow; identify the regression it cannot catch and the maintenance burden it adds.
   - Reject speculative concerns, pure style preferences, duplicate findings, stale evidence, and recommendations without a concrete failure mode or maintainability cost.

5. Report the review.
   - Put findings first, ordered by severity and then confidence.
   - For each finding, include severity (`P0` through `P3`), the narrowest useful file and line reference, triggering conditions, impact, verifying evidence or reproducible counterexample, and a concise correction direction.
   - Keep one root cause per finding. Merge duplicates across reviewers and credit the strongest evidence, not the number of reviewers.
   - Separate confirmed findings from outdated or already-addressed observations, non-actionable questions, and unrelated CI noise.
   - State the exact reviewed range or file set and which tests or diagnostics ran. If no findings remain, say so explicitly and identify any validation gap.

## Common Review Traps

| Initial signal | Required verification |
|---|---|
| Parameterized raw SQL | Injection may be mitigated; require evidence that a typed query over bounded candidates cannot preserve semantics or measured performance. |
| Handler does not read an input | Trace cache keys, routing, serialization, invalidation, and type contracts before calling it dead. |
| Mock-heavy test is green | Identify which production behavior ran, whether the adapter contract is unique, and whether real child plus E2E tests make the scaffold redundant. |
| PR comment or CI failure exists | Match it to the current head SHA, current line, and latest check run before treating it as active. |

## Review Standard

- Prioritize correctness, regressions, security, data loss, broken contracts, user-visible behavior, and concrete maintainability risk.
- Use `P0` for release-blocking catastrophic impact, `P1` for high-impact defects, `P2` for ordinary actionable defects, and `P3` for concrete low-impact or maintainability problems.
- Treat missing tests as a finding only when the patch creates a specific unprotected behavior or regression risk.
- Treat unusual implementation choices as questions until repository evidence proves a safer or simpler equivalent.
- Keep summaries short. A review is useful because its findings are precise, not because it is long.
